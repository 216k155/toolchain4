Aims to be as similar to native Darwin compilers as possible.

Includes full build of cctools, ld64, gcc and llvmgcc.

Almost fully up to date with Apple's Open Source releases.

Fully relocatable; extract where-ever you want.

Supports -arch flag(s) to allow fat binaries (multiarch) to be built from a single invocation.

Source code (i.e. build scripts and patches) available at:

https://github.com/mingwandroid/toolchain4.git

Builds upon work by Open Darwin, saurik (Jay Freeman), iPhoneDev and Andrew Udvare.

You need to provide your own Darwin SDKs which I can't distribute for copyright reasons.
- built and tested against MacOSX10.7.sdk for OSX and iPhoneOS4.3.sdk for iOS.

Licensed under the APSL v2 (cctools), the GPL (gcc, llvmgcc) and the UoI/NCSA (ld64, llvmgcc)

Apple have not released source code for dsymutil which is called by when -g (debugging info) is
passed to gcc. To work around negative effects of this, I've included a tiny program which does
nothing other than returning 0, however, you won't be able to produce .dSYM folders and I'm not
sure if debugging the built software can be achieved.

** Updates **

21-04-12 :: Fixed relocation problem in cpp (gcc headers not being found)
            Added gcc 4.2.1 headers for libstdc++-v3

01-05-12 :: Fixed llvmgcc SDK path bug (sysroot was not being handled correctly)
            Fixed iOS libstdc++-v3 headers location
            Added a dummy dsymutil executable
            Windows :: Fixed search path for cctools executables
