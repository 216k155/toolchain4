Aims to be as similar to native Darwin compilers as possible.

Fairly up to date with Apple's Open Source releases.
- includes cctools-809 [1], ld64-127.2, gcc-5666.3 and llvmgcc-2336.1.

Fully relocatable; extract where-ever you want.

Supports -arch flag(s) to allow fat binaries (multiarch) to be built from a single invocation.

Builds upon work by javacom, Open Darwin, saurik (Jay Freeman), iPhoneDev and Andrew Udvare.

You need to provide your own Darwin SDKs which I can't distribute for copyright reasons.
- built and tested against MacOSX10.7.sdk for OSX and iPhoneOS4.3.sdk for iOS.

Licensed under the APSL v2 (cctools), the GPL (gcc, llvmgcc) and the UoI/NCSA (ld64, llvmgcc)

Apple have not released source code for dsymutil which is called by when -g (debugging info) is
passed to gcc. To work around negative effects of this, I've included a tiny program which does
nothing other than returning 0, however, you won't be able to produce .dSYM folders and I'm not
sure if debugging the built software can be achieved.

[1] On Windows, the following cctools programs do not currently compile:
"seg_addr_table", "checksyms" and "redo_prebinding"

** Updates **

19-04-12 :: Fixed relocation problem in cctools (ar would look for ranlib in the wrong place)

21-04-12 :: Fixed relocation problem in cpp (gcc headers not being found)
            Added gcc 4.2.1 headers for libstdc++-v3

01-05-12 :: Fixed llvmgcc SDK path bug (sysroot was not being handled correctly)
            Fixed iOS libstdc++-v3 headers location
            Added a dummy dsymutil executable
            Windows :: Fixed search path for cctools executables
            Windows :: Added needed dlls (can be used without MinGW)

12-05-12 :: Compilers statically linked to gmp (4.3.2) and mpfr (2.2.1) instead of system libs
            Removed redundant llvmCore installation (llvmgcc *is* still provided)
            Removed some empty directories
            Linux :: Compressed to a tar.xz as 7z isn't 'native' enough

16-05-12 :: 64bit OS X compile fixed (--enable-multilibs added to configure for gcc, llvmgcc)

31-05-12 :: Linux  :: Fix pathing issue introduced by multilibs (uses readlink /proc/self/exe)
            Darwin :: Fix pathing issue introduced by multilibs (uses _NSGetExecutablePath)

14-06-12 :: Windows :: Fix collect2 frameworks bug.
            Windows :: Built using mingw64 (32bit) compilers.

15-06-12 :: Darwin :: Fix pathing issue, properly this time.

22-07-12 :: Linux :: Now built with glibc2.7 compatible GCC, works on Debian 6.0.5.
            Linux :: Fix bug with qsort_r in ld64's macho_relocatable_file.c
